# CS61B: Data Structures

Welcome to CS 61B. The CS 61 series is an introduction to computer science, with particular emphasis on software and machines from a programmer's point of view. In CS 61B, we're concerned also with engineering. An engineer, it is said, is someone who can do for a dime what any fool can do for a dollar. Much of 61B will be concerned with the tradeoffs in time and memory for a variety of methods for structuring data. We'll also be concerned with the engineering knowledge and skills needed to build and maintain moderately large programs. 

This is a course about data structures and programming methods. It happens to also teach Java, since it is hard to teach programming without a language. However, it is not intended as an exhaustive course on Java, the World-Wide Web, creating applets, user interfaces, graphics, or any of that fun stuff.
